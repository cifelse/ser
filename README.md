# Speech Emotion Recognition (SER)
SER stands for Speech Emotion Recognition and is a Jupyter Notebook project that tackles affective computing through audio and speech modals.

## Prerequisites
In order to run this project, you need to have the following installed:
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) (or alternatively just install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download))

## Running Locally
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cifelse/ser.git
```
2. At the root of the folder run the Main.ipynb file with your respective Jupyter Notebook environment (we personally prefer Anacoda)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The notebook installs some additional but required packages and heavily relies on pip. Make sure you have pip installed and added to your PATH.
